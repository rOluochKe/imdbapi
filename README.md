# IMDB API

This IMDB API Application, developed using Python, Django, Django Rest Framework (DRF), and PostgreSQL, offers a comprehensive platform for accessing and utilizing data from the IMDB (Internet Movie Database) database.

Python serves as the core programming language, while Django and DRF provide a powerful framework for building the backend logic and creating APIs to fetch and manipulate IMDB data.

The PostgreSQL database ensures efficient and reliable storage of the IMDB data, enabling seamless retrieval and querying of movie information.

This application allows users to search for movies, access detailed information such as cast, crew, ratings, and reviews, and perform various data manipulations.

Using Django Rest Framework, we ensure secure and efficient API endpoints for retrieving and updating IMDB data. Users can integrate this API into their own applications or use it for research, analysis, or other purposes.

The IMDB API Application, built using Python, Django, Django Rest Framework, and PostgreSQL, opens up a world of possibilities for accessing and leveraging the vast movie database of IMDB in a flexible and convenient manner.
